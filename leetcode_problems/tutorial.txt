Points
======

1) space complexity is O(1) if no extra space is used.

2) use bitwise operators to check for odd/even and half/double or check bits of a number - &, x >> 1 <- move digits of x to right.
It is faster computation wise.

3) substring is continuous; subsequence is not eg- str = "abcde"; substring= abc; subsequence=abd

4)
